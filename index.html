Outline: Tower, inconspicuously located next to city of Light once owned and inhibited by Noble Wizard Shitheed - consort of Princess of Light. His research into constructs was world-renowned but when his sudden silence occured his tower was still untouched for many years. When brave explorers were born and went - their corpses became the warnings - <br>

<h1>Mapping</h1> 

Volunteer to be the party mapper - ask or assign Solnishko!

<h1>Time of Year</h1>

Whatever. The Tower is still standing and magically preserved - it will be standing for thousands of years still. 

<h1>Adventure Hooks</h1>

Adventurers can find the Tower within a close vicinity to City of Light northern wall and to the village. The characters can be drawn to the dungeon for any of the following reasons. 

<h3>Going for Glory</h3>
You are eager to make a name for yourself. The legend of the Tower is well known locally, and stories indicate it is a place that holds promise for those intent on discovery, glory, and treasure!

<h3>Rescue Mission</h3>
Another party of adventurers, locally based, delved into the Sunless Citadel a month past. They were never seen again. Two human members of that ill fated-party were brother and sister.

<h3>Solving a Mystery</h3>
There is something Necrotically wrong with the Tower, but what is it?

<h1>Village of Light

Closest settlement to The Tower - down by the Old Road...</h1>

<div id="story">
All things can be summoned: horrors or not,
Simply avoid the rot,
Dungeons go deeper than you think,
Remember to keep the link,
Dead quest is not the end of game,
Lost honor does not bring you shame!
